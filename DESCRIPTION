Description: The reflectR package provides a tool for researchers and psychologists to automatically code open-ended responses to the Cognitive Reflection Test 2 (CRT-2), a widely used tool in cognitive science and psychology for assessing an individual's propensity to override an incorrect gut response and engage in further reflection to find a correct answer (Thomson & Oppenheimer, 2016).    This package facilitates the standardization of CRT-2 response analysis across large datasets in cognitive psychology, decision-making, and related fields. By automating the coding process, it not only reduces manual effort but also aims to reduce the variability introduced by subjective interpretation of open-ended responses, contributing to a more consistent and reliable analysis. 
    Note: While reflectR draws inspiration from the principles and scientific literature underlying the CRT-2, it has been independently developed and does not hold any affiliation with the original authors of the CRT-2.
